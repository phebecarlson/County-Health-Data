# County-Health-Data
 MySQL with County Health Data

This project utilizes Python and Jupyter Notebooks to instantiate and populate a MySQL database using data from https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation
Thank you to Shikshya Adhikari for suggesting this dataset. 

The 2021 County Health Rankings National Data dataset contains numerous variables relating to different measures of health and quality of life. These variables cover income, race, access to healthcare, internet access, and much more. 

I narrowed this dataset to include a few variables of interest, created two csv files -- Counties Ranked by Health Outcomes and Health Factors and Additional Measure Data affecting health. These csvs were loaded and inserted into a local MySQL database using Python and SQL.

Exploration of the data was performed in both Python and SQL. Joining the two dataframes was done in SQL.
